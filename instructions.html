        <h3> Welcome to our Card Matching Game! Here's how you can play and have fun:</h3> </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Objective:</strong> The goal is to match pairs of cards with the same value.</li>
        <li><strong>Game Setup:</strong> You will see a grid of cards face down. Click on a card to flip it over.</li>
        <li><strong>Playing:</strong> Flip two cards at a time to see if they match. If they do, they will remain face up. If not, they will flip back over. Remember what's on each card and where it is.</li>
        <li><strong>Winning:</strong> The game ends when all pairs are matched. Try to match all pairs with the fewest moves to achieve the highest score.</li>
        <li><strong>Scoring:</strong> You earn points for each match and lose points for mismatches.</li>
